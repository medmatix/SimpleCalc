# SimpleCalc
A Simple Calculator project in python
  
A programming project in python to implement with tkinter a simple arithmetic calculator. This is mainly an exercise but free for all to review and use if found helpful.Enjoy.

This is implemented with python 3.7 and is a work in progress. 

It is growing in functionality as new operations are added, increasingly from the numpy library. Plans are to add a function graphing capability via mathplotlib. I hope you follow allong and comment freely. Afterall, this is first and formost part of my learning experience.

I have tried to open my thinking process to view by including mind maps, doodles and UML models as I develop and grow this application. The screenshot for Version 1.24 is below.

INTRODUCTION:

Welcome to the Simple Calculator Project Application (app),It has been written in python as a python programming excercise. Please enjoy using it, reading the code and feel free to share constructive comments.
The SimpleCalc app is a reverse polish notation (like the HP calculators) where the operands are entered fully before an operator is selected. The operands entered of cpource depend on whether a unary of binary operator is to be used. For a simple addition binary operation that would be:

    <OPERAND><ENTER>OPERAND<ENTER><OPERATOR>
			
  i.e.    1<ENTER>2<ENTER><+>
  output  3
			
All operands, including constant keys PI, e, and phi still need and <ENTER> after like any such input.

To assist with chaining of operations, output (results) of operators and functions are always automatically entered entered after being calculated, i.e. the <+> is really a <+>-<ENTER> operation pair.
			
The a unary operation like a SQRT function requires only prior entry of a single operand, and once again the unary operation (being a function) automatically enters the result for the next operation. So that,

		 55<ENTER><SQRT> 
					
  is actually,
				
		 55<ENTER><SQRT><ENTER>
